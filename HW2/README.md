# Homework 2
* [2-1 Video Caption Generation]
* [2-2 Chatbot]

## Note
### 2-1 Video Caption Generation
* Implement [Sequence to Sequence - Video to Text (S2VT)]
* Training tips
  - [x] Use word embedding (instead of one-hot encoding)
  - [x] Attention (although the paper claimed S2VT can work well without attention)
  - [x] Teacher forcing
  - [ ] Beam search
### 2-2 Chatbot
* Training tips
  - [x] Use word embedding
  - [x] Attention
  - [x] Teacher forcing
  - [ ] Beam search (to do)
